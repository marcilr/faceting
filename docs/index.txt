Index the document


The standard subject index is created using the following procedure:

1. Include \index{entry} commands wherever you want an index entry.
2. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
3. Put a \printindex command where the index is to appear, 
   normally before the \end{document} command.
