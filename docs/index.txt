Index the document


The standard subject index is created using the following procedure:

1. Include \index{entry} commands wherever you want an index entry.
2. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
3. Put a \printindex command where the index is to appear, 
   normally before the \end{document} command.

================================
Testing building an index:


1. Include \index{entry} commands wherever you want an index entry.
For oval.tex added:

%% =================== Oval =======================
%% =================== Oval ======================= 
\newpage
\subsection{Oval}
\index{oval}        <===

2. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
160:%% 2. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
168:\usepackage{makeidx}
169:\makeidx

3, $ grep -ni \printindex faceting.tex 
161:%% 3. Put a \printindex command where the index is to appear, \
normally before the \end{document} command.
347:\printindex                                                          %% Index
348:\end{document}

4. cd ~/git/faceting/tex/00SECTIONS/design/oval
$ makeindex oval.tex 
This is makeindex, version 2.15 [TeX Live 2019/dev] (kpathsea + Thai support).
Scanning input file oval.tex...done (0 entries accepted, 18 rejected).
Nothing written in oval.ind.
Transcript written in oval.ilg.
$

4. For appendix.tex appended:
\printindex                                                          %% Index

5. Build faceting document:
$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex/
$ make cycle
$

6. Now creating an empty index at the end of the document.
