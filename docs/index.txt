Index the document




The standard subject index is created using the following procedure:

1. Include \index{entry} commands wherever you want an index entry.
2. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
3. Put a \printindex command where the index is to appear, 
   normally before the \end{document} command.

Which command is responsible for printing the index in LaTeX?
Finally, the command \printindex will actually render the index.

================================
Updated Makefile to build index:

Added index file variables:
  IDX = $(BASENAME).idx
  ILG = $(BASENAME).ilg
  IND = $(BASENAME).ind

Updated mostly-clean target to remove index files:
  $(RM) -f $(IDX) $(ILG) $(IND)

Updated dvi target with makeindex to create the index:
  $(MAKEINDEX) $(IDX)
  $(LATEX) $(TMP)

================================
Having another go at adding index to the faceting document.

1. Add \usepackage{makeidx} in the preamble of the root/main TeX file. 
Added \usepackage{makeidx} to faceting.tex:

$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex/
$ grep -ni "\usepackage{makeidx}" faceting.tex 
160:%% 2. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
168:\usepackage{makeidx}


2. Add \makeindex in the preamble, just before \begin{document} is suggested.

faceting.tex:265
\makeindex
\begin{document}

Searching for above:

$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex
$ grep -ni makeindex faceting.tex 
160:%% 2. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
265:\makeindex
$


3. Add \printindex where a user wants the index to appear. 
Usually, it is suggested to place just right before 
\end{document} command.

faceting.tex:347
\printindex
\end{document}


Searching for above:

$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex
$ grep -ni end{document} faceting.tex 
33:%% \end{document}
114:%% \end{document}
161:%% 3. Put a \printindex command where the index is to appear, normally before the \end{document} command.
348:\end{document}
$

Not getting index on inspection of build from:
$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex
$ make cycle
...

That said see entries in faceting.idx:

~/git/faceting/tex/faceting.idx:
\indexentry{abstract|hyperpage}{1}
\indexentry{Aussies|hyperpage}{10}
\indexentry{faceting machine|hyperpage}{16}
\indexentry{oval|hyperpage}{25}

However the faceting.ind is empty:

$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex/
$ cat faceting.ind 
$

Looks like the key to producing the idn file is to run:
makeindex jobname.idx, from the command line.

Added index taget to the faceting Makefile to do so.

Suspect the issue is that the index item is in the 
oval.tex subfile.

Hence need to use:
$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex
$ makeindex faceting
This is makeindex, version 2.15 [TeX Live 2019/dev] (kpathsea + Thai support).
Scanning input file faceting.idx....done (4 entries accepted, 0 rejected).
Sorting entries....done (9 comparisons).
Generating output file faceting.ind....done (14 lines written, 0 warnings).
Output written in faceting.ind.
Transcript written in faceting.ilg.
$


o The faceting.idx index file is getting built by the Makefile
o This is used to produce the appropriate entries in faceting.ind

o However the faceting.ind is not getting built nor the index
itself.

o Again using 'makeindex faceting' at the command line populates
the faceting.ind after doing an intial 'make' to get the faceting.idx
with index entries.

Hence:
1. Run make to build faceting.idx
2. run 'makeindex faceting' to build faceting.ind
3. Build with index?

Need to fix/update the above instructions.

The outstanding question is how to build the index with the hierarchy of tex files?

  How do I create an index in TeX?
  1. Indexing in LaTeX
  2. Include \index{entry} commands wherever you want an index entry.
  3. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
     Put a \printindex command where the index is to appear, normally 
     before the \end{document} command.

  LaTeX/Indexing
  package makeidx
  LaTeX supports the creation of indices with its package makeidx, 
  and its support program makeindex , called on some systems makeidx .
  LaTeX/Indexing - Wikibooks, open books for an open world
  1. To enable the indexing feature of LaTeX, the makeidx package 
     must be loaded in the preamble:

     faceting.tex:
     168:\usepackage{makeidx}

  2. Enable the special indexing commands by the \makeindex in input file:
     faceting.tex
     265:\makeindex

  3. Tell LaTex what to index using the \index{key} command:
     oval.tex:
     10:\index{oval}

  https://en.wikibooks.org > wiki > LaTeX > Indexing
  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing

  Running 'make cycle' builds the faceting.idx with index items.
  However not getting index in final document.

  This document does have a clean 2-column index!!!
  https://www.ams.org/arc/tex/howto/index/0index-notes.pdf

  I think the key is using /usr/bin/makeindex against all the 
  tex files.

================================
Testing building an index:

1. Include \index{entry} commands wherever you want an index entry.
For oval.tex added:

%% =================== Oval =======================
%% =================== Oval ======================= 
\newpage
\subsection{Oval}
\index{oval}        <===

2. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
160:%% 2. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
168:\usepackage{makeidx}
169:\makeidx

3, $ grep -ni \printindex faceting.tex 
161:%% 3. Put a \printindex command where the index is to appear, \
normally before the \end{document} command.
347:\printindex                                                          %% Index
348:\end{document}

4. cd ~/git/faceting/tex/00SECTIONS/design/oval
$ makeindex oval.tex 
This is makeindex, version 2.15 [TeX Live 2019/dev] (kpathsea + Thai support).
Scanning input file oval.tex...done (0 entries accepted, 18 rejected).
Nothing written in oval.ind.
Transcript written in oval.ilg.
$

4. For appendix.tex appended:
\printindex                                                          %% Index

5. Build faceting document:
$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex/
$ make cycle
$

6. Now creating an empty index at the end of the document.
