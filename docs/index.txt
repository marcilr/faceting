Index the document




The standard subject index is created using the following procedure:

1. Include \index{entry} commands wherever you want an index entry.
2. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
3. Put a \printindex command where the index is to appear, 
   normally before the \end{document} command.

Which command is responsible for printing the index in LaTeX?
Finally, the command \printindex will actually render the index.

================================
Having another go at adding index to the faceting document.

1. Add \usepackage{makeidx} in the preamble of the root/main TeX file. 
Added \usepackage{makeidx} to faceting.tex:

$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex/
$ grep -ni "\usepackage{makeidx}" faceting.tex 
160:%% 2. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
168:\usepackage{makeidx}


2. Add \makeindex in the preamble, just before \begin{document} is suggested.

faceting.tex:265
\makeindex
\begin{document}

Searching for above:

$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex
$ grep -ni makeindex faceting.tex 
160:%% 2. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
265:\makeindex
$


3. Add \printindex where a user wants the index to appear. 
Usually, it is suggested to place just right before 
\end{document} command.

faceting.tex:347
\printindex
\end{document}


Searching for above:

$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex
$ grep -ni end{document} faceting.tex 
33:%% \end{document}
114:%% \end{document}
161:%% 3. Put a \printindex command where the index is to appear, normally before the \end{document} command.
348:\end{document}
$

Not getting index on inspection of build from:
$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex
$ make cycle
...

That said see entries in faceting.idx:

~/git/faceting/tex/faceting.idx:
\indexentry{abstract|hyperpage}{1}
\indexentry{Aussies|hyperpage}{10}
\indexentry{faceting machine|hyperpage}{16}
\indexentry{oval|hyperpage}{25}

However the faceting.ind is empty:

$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex/
$ cat faceting.ind 
$

Looks like the key to producing the idn file is to run:
makeindex jobname.idx, from the command line.

Added index taget to the faceting Makefile to do so.

Suspect the issue is that the index item is in the 
oval.tex subfile.

Hence need to use:
$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex
$ makeindex faceting
This is makeindex, version 2.15 [TeX Live 2019/dev] (kpathsea + Thai support).
Scanning input file faceting.idx....done (4 entries accepted, 0 rejected).
Sorting entries....done (9 comparisons).
Generating output file faceting.ind....done (14 lines written, 0 warnings).
Output written in faceting.ind.
Transcript written in faceting.ilg.
$

The faceting.idx index file is getting built.
This appeared to produce the appropriate entries in faceting.ind

================================
Testing building an index:

1. Include \index{entry} commands wherever you want an index entry.
For oval.tex added:

%% =================== Oval =======================
%% =================== Oval ======================= 
\newpage
\subsection{Oval}
\index{oval}        <===

2. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
160:%% 2. Include \usepackage{makeidx} and \makeindex in the preamble.
168:\usepackage{makeidx}
169:\makeidx

3, $ grep -ni \printindex faceting.tex 
161:%% 3. Put a \printindex command where the index is to appear, \
normally before the \end{document} command.
347:\printindex                                                          %% Index
348:\end{document}

4. cd ~/git/faceting/tex/00SECTIONS/design/oval
$ makeindex oval.tex 
This is makeindex, version 2.15 [TeX Live 2019/dev] (kpathsea + Thai support).
Scanning input file oval.tex...done (0 entries accepted, 18 rejected).
Nothing written in oval.ind.
Transcript written in oval.ilg.
$

4. For appendix.tex appended:
\printindex                                                          %% Index

5. Build faceting document:
$ cd ~/git/faceting/tex/
$ make cycle
$

6. Now creating an empty index at the end of the document.
